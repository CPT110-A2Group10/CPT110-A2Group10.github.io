    <p>The Sleep, IT, Repeat group has a diverse range of ideal careers which vary from the IT industry through to financial planning.
</p><p><br>Both Daniel and Michael’s ideal job involves developing and being in charge of a “startup company”.  A “startup company” is a business which is developing or creating a new product which they believe is in demand.  Although they are both interested in beginning a startup, the motivation is somewhat different.  Daniel is interested in laying the ground-work for a less corporate business that will be followed and used by a successful team as either a Chief Information Officer or Chief Technology Officer.  Whereas Michael’s area of interest is education.  Michael would like to create a startup company that will use IT to provide tools and resources to remote areas and children from low socio-economic backgrounds to assist and improve education and learning. (Grant & Kenton 2019)</p><p><br>Andrew has become interested in programing and wants to design software and applications. Games design is a very interesting field and Andrew would love to be able to crack into that market working for a large design firm with the flexibility and resources to create and design unique innovative programs.  Ideally, he’d like to be in charge of a design or programming team.</p><p><br>Shane’s ideal job is a Cyber Security Analyst.  This involves protecting individuals and organisations from cyber threats through the use of various technology systems.  The extent of preventing and protecting can include securing and monitoring websites, computers, data and networks from viruses, malware, spyware and hacking.  This role is becoming a necessity in most modern business today since much of today’s business is carried out through the internet and networking.</p><p><br>Ashleigh is studying in the financial planning field.  Ashleigh’s ideal job is a Financial Adviser of a successful financial planning firm.  At the right time, she hopes to become an equity partner and build a business that assists people to manage and build wealth, protect themselves and their estate should anything happen to them, and educate youth on how to best manage money in today’s economic environment.  IT will assist to provide education and advice to consumers electronically and continues to provide platforms that assist in making this process easier.</p><p><br>Although our team is varied in its ideal jobs, each of us would ultimately like to use IT to create, improve and expand future operations in our various fields.
