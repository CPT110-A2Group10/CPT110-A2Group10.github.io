    <p>The Sleep, IT, Repeat group has a diverse range of ideal careers which vary from the IT industry through to financial planning.
</p><p><br>Both Daniel and Michael’s ideal job involves developing and being in charge of a “startup company”.  A “startup company” is a business which is developing or creating a new product which they believe is in demand.  Although they are both interested in beginning a startup, the motivation is somewhat different.  Daniel is interested in laying the ground-work for a less corporate business that will be followed and used by a successful team as either a Chief Information Officer or Chief Technology Officer.  Whereas Michael’s area of interest is education.  Michael would like to create a startup company that will use IT to provide tools and resources to remote areas and children from low socio-economic backgrounds to assist and improve education and learning. (Grant & Kenton 2019)</p><p><br>Andrew has become interested in programing and wants to design software and applications. Games design is a very interesting field and Andrew would love to be able to crack into that market working for a large design firm with the flexibility and resources to create and design unique innovative programs.  Ideally, he’d like to be in charge of a design or programming team.</p><p><br>Shane’s ideal job is a Cyber Security Analyst.  This involves protecting individuals and organisations from cyber threats through the use of various technology systems.  The extent of preventing and protecting can include securing and monitoring websites, computers, data and networks from viruses, malware, spyware and hacking.  This role is becoming a necessity in most modern business today since much of today’s business is carried out through the internet and networking.</p><p><br>Ashleigh is studying in the financial planning field.  Ashleigh’s ideal job is a Financial Adviser of a successful financial planning firm.  At the right time, she hopes to become an equity partner and build a business that assists people to manage and build wealth, protect themselves and their estate should anything happen to them, and educate youth on how to best manage money in today’s economic environment.  IT will assist to provide education and advice to consumers electronically and continues to provide platforms that assist in making this process easier.</p><p><br>Although our team is varied in its ideal jobs, each of us would ultimately like to use IT to create, improve and expand future operations in our various fields.

  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" >Industry Data</h3>
  <h4>Group Ideal Jobs</h4>
  <p>Although the ideal jobs vary across the group, the areas of Professional, Scientific & Technical Services was ranked number 4 in Australia’s largest employing industry documented in the Australia Jobs 2018 Report provided by the Australian Government.  The report revealed the industries that are most likely to experience a high level of growth over the next 5 years.  The report states the top 5 occupations within the Professional, Scientific & Technical Services industry, with software and applications programmers making the list.  This indicates that demand for our group’s ideal jobs are high.  (Acharya 2019)</p>
  <p>It can be argued that the demand for positions within the software and applications industry is likely to continue beyond 5 years since the world in which we live, continues to incorporate technology into our day-to-day lives including how we communicate, how we do business and even how we do our banking and manage our finances.  Without employees in IT, we could not continue to evolve and expand in this area.</p>
  <h4>Group’s Required Skill Set</h4>
  <p><strong>General Skills</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Communication</li>
  <li>Problem Solving</li>
  <li>Team Work</li>
  <li>Organisational Abilities</li>
  <li>Technical Knowledge</li>
  <li>Relevant Qualifications</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our required skill set sits towards the top of the Burning Glass Technologies "Skills in Greatest Demand" list with Communication being the most demanded skill and the others ranked highly below. Demand for each of these skills to likely to be high from employers, regardless of the industry. These skills generally make for a good employee and will ultimately correlate with the success of the business.</p>
  <p>The 3 highest ranked general skills, not in our required skill set are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Interpersonal Skills</li>
  <li>Planning / Project Management</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>IT-Specific Skills</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Experience with programming,.net, SQL, etc</li>
  <li>Project &amp; Business Management</li>
  <li>Knowledge of technical trends</li>
  <li>Technological and analysis research</li>
  <li>Leadership experience</li>
  <li>Building Relationships</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The IT specific skills that make up the Group&rsquo;s required skill set are marked highly amongst the &ldquo;Skills in Greatest Demand&rdquo; Report by Burning Glass. Developing a startup company, programming, cybersecurity and financial planning all require technical experience and knowledge within their respective areas of expertise and requires a high level of management skill.</p>
  <p>The 3 highest ranked IT skills (not in required skill set) are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Graphic Design</li>
  <li>Customer Service</li>
  <li>Technical Support</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many of the other skills set out in the report are areas in which our group would likely be expected to have to achieve our ideal job goals.</p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>The data supplied within the Burning Glass reports have not changed our ideal jobs nor have they changed our opinions. This is because we are all of the belief that our ideal jobs are ones that will be demanded well into the future. As discussed earlier, technology is incorporated in most parts of our lives, even to the extent that the world relies on it to achieve continuing economic growth. This means IT specific positions will be well sought after for years to come.</p>

<!-- IT Work -->
<div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="ITWork">
  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">IT Work</h3>
  <p>This is a profile of an IT Professional based on the 1-1 interview. This IT professional works at SE Victoria government school with five campuses located at different suburbs. He has a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and has been working at the school for over 7 years. His official title is Educational Support IT Technician and is the only IT Technician at the school. Most of his time is spent in the main campus office.</p>
  <h4>ES IT Technician responsibilities</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>To set up and maintain computers, laptop, Ipad, printers and design computer networks</li>
  <li>To install, configure the usability of system hardware and software</li>
  <li>Offer daily operations and systems support to admin staff</li>
  <li>Create and manage staff and student user accounts by creating a group policy which allow access to different machines depending on the users account</li>
  <li>Verify functionality of hardware and software components</li>
  <li>Troubleshoot hardware and software issues in person and remotely</li>
  <li>Assist employees with computer problems and answer their questions</li>
  <li>Set up and monitor data storage systems for the local and remote networks</li>
  <li>Conduct daily network backup operations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The most challenging part of the job he has found is troubleshooting and dealing with unreasonable demands from staff. Sometimes staff can be challenging, because they do not have the knowledge of IT and they can not see why certain things can not be done or done in the time they need it. He finds sometimes the workload is overwhelming, often the result of him being the only IT technician in a big school.</p>

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="ITTechnologies">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" >IT Technologies</h3>
    <h4>Area 1 - Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, where algorithms improve themselves as they are fed data, finding patterns and figuring things out without explicitly being told.</p>
    <p>Machine learning is still in its infancy but has already come a long way. It has already been used in the health industry to do tasks such as diagnosing eye disease and predicting hospital wait times, as well as many other applications (Vincent, 2018). Countries around the world are utilising it to increase the development of autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons for military use (Cronk, 2019). It is also being used in economics, with companies like Paypal announcing that machine learning is the future of credit scoring and fraud prevention (Shah, 2019). Machine learning has aided the creation of semi-automated cars, which have made their way onto roads recently, with fully automated cars to follow in the near future. The one application that has already impacted most people is machine learning in digital advertising. Targeted advertising is everywhere and algorithms are constantly finding new strategies that increase sales. As algorithms continue to improve, its predictive capabilities will increase in accuracy.</p>
    <p>In the coming years machine learning will have a far-reaching global impact and as it is integrated into consumer products will become a part of daily life. Spending on artificial intelligence and machine learning is forecast to reach $35.8 billion globally in 2019, and to double by 2022 (IDC, 2018). If there is data available, machine learning is either already being utilised or looking to be.</p>
    <p>Education and training will also feel a major impact as there will be a change in what jobs exist and what skills will be in demand. White-collar workers are the most likely to be displaced, and many jobs such as ones based around repetitive tasks that can be automated have already started being taken by machine learning. Jobs that require analysing and processing data will also be automated. Machine learning will replace jobs in almost every industry, but will also create new jobs. People-oriented jobs and are not likely to be replaced by machine learning.</p>
    <p>These changes will affect my daily life, especially in regards to employment since I will be working in the IT industry. It also means extra consideration is required when making career decisions, as in the next few decades there are going to be some areas that will become redundant while others will grow. A lot of the jobs available to everyone may be different in the near future and some qualifications may no longer be of any value. Machine learning will make everyday life easier as this technology continues making its way into consumer products and improves and becomes more complex.</p>
    <h4>Area 2 - Autonomous Vehicles</h4>
    <p>Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that are capable of driving themselves with little to no human input. They use artificial intelligence combined with sensors to perform driver tasks.</p>
    <p>There are multiple levels of automation and we have not yet reached them all. SAE (SAE International 2018) lists the five levels as Driver Assistance, Partial Automation, Conditional Automation, High Automation, and Full Automation. Semi-autonomous vehicles which are level two and function like a high-level cruise control requiring driver supervision are already on the roads, with fully autonomous cars expected to join them in the future. Major vehicle companies are investing billions of dollars into artificial intelligence software and tech for their autonomous vehicles (Walker, 2019).</p>
    <p>Many automakers have announced timelines for their vehicles and what levels they expect to get to within the next few years. Ford is expecting to have a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel by 2021, whereas Honda, Toyota and Hyundai are a bit less optimistic, aiming for cars capable of full autonomy when highway driving by 2020 (Walker). Tesla has been at the forefront of autonomous vehicles and already have cars with the required hardware, ready for when the software catches up to become fully autonomous (Walker).</p>
    <p>The biggest impact autonomous cars will have will be the prevention of car accidents. There are around 1.25 million deaths globally due to motor vehicle accidents, 94% of which are caused by human error (Singh, 2015). Autonomous cars could prevent those accidents, saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Other major changes on our roads will be the automation of lift services, and possibly these services replacing the need to own your own car.</p>
    <p>The research into autonomous vehicles is creating thousands of new jobs for engineers and computer scientists, and as research into the hardware and software required for high functioning artificial intelligence gets more funding it leads to improvements in other related fields, such as robotics and consumer technology.</p>
    <p>In my daily life, autonomous vehicles will likely eventually replace my need for a car. It will also make the roads safer for myself and everyone else I know. The increased funding into artificial intelligence and machine learning will make its way into other fields and create new consumer technologies that don&rsquo;t yet exist.</p>
    <h4>Area 3 - Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots</h4>
    <p>Natural language processing is the interaction between human and computer language that analyses and processes data. Although progress has improved over the years, there are still challenges with speech or accent recognition.</p>
    <p>The first recorded work of natural language processing dates back to the early 1950s however there were talks of this technology prior to this. Alan Turing proposed the idea in an article titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence. This has become known as the Turing test originally published in 1950. In 1954 the Georgetown experiment involved the automatic translation of sixty Russian sentences into English. Throughout the 1960s further advancements in automatic translation moved slowly and continued right up until the late 1980s when machine learning algorithms were introduced. This breakthrough was due to several factors. First the increase in computing power with modern machines, and secondly with the lessening of the Chomskyan theory of linguistics. The theoretic underpinnings of the Chomskyan theory discouraged the corpus linguistics that is required for the machine learning of language processing.</p>
    <p>In more recent years, representation learning and deep neural network style machine learning methods have become common in natural language processing. This is due to the state of the art results and techniques. An example of this is the use of word embeddings, which captures properties of words and even question answering. The most common algorithms that are being used now are focussing on unsupervised or semi-supervised programs. These particular algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been predetermined. Risks with this particular technology rise with machines often using unreliable information from the internet.</p>
    <p>A chatbot, or more commonly chatterbox, is a computer program that was designed to perform conversationally as a human would. Uses for the chatbot include phone answering software, marketing, education, games, and online virtual assistants, etc. The first chatbot was created by Michael Mauldin in 1994 when he designed &lsquo;JULIA&rsquo;, a chatbot development software kit mostly used by Microsoft. This was based heavily on ELIZA, a 1966 program designed by Joseph Weizenbaum. ELIZA was considered believable as a human however was certainly not intelligent and could only speak pre-programmed phrases. Technology for the chatbot is based on the works of Alan Turing, however at this stage in 2019 still does not have the capabilities required to pass the Turing test.</p>
    <h4>Area 4 - Arduinon, Raspberry Pi and Makey Makey</h4>
    <p>This is a brief description of Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Makey Makey. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi are both micro controllers with its own microprocessor chip. They are like a mini-computer that can run programs to control electronic components. Arduino and Raspberry Pi have developed different models, each model having specific assemblage components. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi motherboards have I/O pins to attach other electronic devices. They cannot do anything without being programmed. The program codes are input into the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), once the code is complete it can be downloaded to the microprocessor via USB ports.</p>
    <p>Arduino is Opensource microcontroller, both software and hardware are Opensource too. This means that it is available to anybody to copy. There are many companies that have created their own cheaper versions of Arduino. This is great for anyone that wants to make an electronic project. There has been many amazing projects created using the Arduino, which can be seen in the Arduino project hub webpage (<a title="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub" href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub</a>). To create a project the Arduino boards can be bought by itself or in kits. The Arduino shields are circuit boards that allow for additional capabilities which are can be bought separately. With additional shields other electronic parts can be added such as; sensors, motors and electronic displays. The Arduino IDE can be downloaded from the Arduino website (<a title="https://www.arduino.cc/" href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.arduino.cc/</a>). Arduino use its own version of C programming language and the extensive coding libraries that is free to use. The downside with Arduino its small memory capacity and it can only run one program at a time. Also, if you want to have Bluetooth and other features Arduino Shields have to be added.</p>
    <p>Raspberry Pi can run more than one program at a time. This is because it has its own Operating System (OS) which is free (<a title="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/</a>) and have its own desktop. From the desktop the user can choose different IDE to program. You have the option of choosing scratch for those who don&rsquo;t have any experience in coding. Scratch was created by MIT to encourage and teach students to code in Python. For those with more experience Debian or IDLE Python are also included in the desktop. The most recent model Raspberry Pi 4 board has bigger memory up to 4G, three different type USB ports, ethernet, two micro HDMI, Bluetooth and wireless.</p>
    <p>Makey Makey (<a title="https://makeymakey.com/" href="https://makeymakey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://makeymakey.com/</a>) is a product created by MIT Media Lab. It is a two sided circuit board touchpad with six input sockets to attach wires. Once the board has been connected to a PC or laptop via USB, the alligator clips can be linked to any object that conducts electricity. By attaching these wires with alligator clips to everyday objects it turns them into touchpads. Makey Makey can be attached to Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards.</p>
    <p>The Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Makey Mare are simple, but not too simple. They were built around the idea that students will be using these. Teaches future designers, artists, engineers and improved learning by building on ideas and sharing ideas. These micro-controllers make it possible to build affordable computers, which put digital making into the hands of people all over the world. These devices have proven that computing could be smaller and cheaper. There are many ways in which they have made positive contribution. It&rsquo;s used in classrooms, used by hobbyist and within the industrial environment. People of all ages have used them to learn about computing and electronics. What makes them so appealing are many experiments that led to creating products we never could have imagined.&nbsp;</p>

  <!-- Project Section -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="projects">
  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" id="LMS">Project - A Learning Management System (LMS)</h3>
  <p>The project is to create a desktop or mobile application library similar to the Open eBooks application (<a title="http://openebooks.net" href="http://openebooks.net">http://openebooks.net</a>). This project is based on my belief that all children should have access to good education and good quality information. As we have all been told that one of the main pathways to economic success is the undertaking of additional years of education. The better educated are usually characterised by lower rates of unemployment, higher earnings, and more prestigious occupational standing.</p>
  <p>UNESCO (<a title="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/gefi/priorities/quality-of-learning" href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/gefi/priorities/quality-of-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.unesco.org/new/en/gefi/priorities/quality-of-learning</a>) points out that there are 57 million children out of school and 617 million youth worldwide lack basic mathematics and literacy skills. To begin with, I propose to create a project that targets local schools then hopefully go global.</p>
  <p>Ben Edwards and Jennifer Baxter article (2014) examined access to educational services in the disadvantaged region in Australia, which shows that Australian children in regional areas have poorer learning outcomes for children living in these areas. Free access to an online library for secondary and primary schools and students. This library is like the way university online library works. The difference is that content will be age appropriate and will have a look of a search engine. Students will have 10 days free access to digital books, audios, pictures, and videos.</p>
  <p>Currently, it is very difficult for students to do any proper research on the internet because they are constantly having to filter advertisements and fake or incorrect information. The current filter that is used in a government school doesn&rsquo;t work. When students search for information online sometimes good websites are blocked and bad ones are not. In my many years of teaching experience, I still struggle to monitor and guide students while they research online. Often, I have directed students to websites that I have vetted, but because student access is restricted students are then left with information that I can&rsquo;t be sure is correct or safe. The current government school online is not able to distinguish between good and bad online content. There are so many local libraries that offer online access to books, it would be great to be able to have access to them in a desktop or mobile application.</p>
  <p>To set up this project several things that should be considered:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Technical staff and time are available for development.</li>
  <li>Staff with a deep knowledge of the library system.</li>
  <li>Affordability and price of the service.</li>
  <li>Sharing the service with other organisation.</li>
  <li>Who are the potential subscribers and how to manage their accounts?</li>
  <li>What ebook content to be included?</li>

  <p>It is important to look at systems that are already in use like the one used by lots of university institution. Dallis and Popp (2012) explain the Web-scale discovery service (WSD) is a central search and retrieval interface index, which contain a library&rsquo;s locally hosted and remotely licensed content.</p>
  <p>The eLGAR's Smart System Project (Fletcher, B. 2009) in New Zealand showed the type of challenges and some consideration of what to expect when implementing this project. Although the NZ project is different from what is being proposed, there are similar requirements that are needed. Fletcher (2009) advises making use of professional outside help. For example, the legislative requirement of government bodies to provide this service and possible solutions were for funding. eLGAR project points out that the importance of high degree of cooperation with the government and a local organisation that will use and funds the project.</p>
  <p>In developing this project I believe we should procure a software license from Open eBook or develop our own app that is similar. Also learn from organisations like Open eBook and Digital Public of America (<a title="https://dp.la/" href="https://dp.la/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dp.la/</a>) so that we are able to have a better understanding of library systems. We have to make sure to "plan for the future and buy capacity to grow the system" (Fletcher, B. 2009).</p>
